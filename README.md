Basically, me and other students received a sheet with dozens of possible architecture implementations and we had to build a class diagram and eventually build the given system,
or work on the final mockup project that was to be released so we could implement the expected objectives we selected for the project. Also we had a strike along with the semester; given the situation,
I managed to build this study project to see if I could figure out a little more about Java Programming.

That said, there are a few methods to still be implemented but this program allows us to register clients and employees, menu products for the restaurant menu, open up tabs and generate their billings after adding items to ther tabs.
Is still a ongoing project since there is no deadline.

Thanks for reading!
